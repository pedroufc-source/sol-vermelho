  "2154": "Nice one, asshole, you shot your load all over the shop. Now Bubby's gonna hurt you.",
  "2155": "You shit, the truck blew outside a goddamn kiddies home! Bubby's real pissed now.",
  "2156": "Hey! What ya playin' at? How the hell ya gonna make a bang without explosives?",
  "2157": "Tommy's mincemeat thanks to you. Now his mom's mighty pissed and out for your ass.",
  "2158": "You lost him, shithead!",
  "2159": "You were meant to waste the lawyer AFTER he led ya to the others, asshole.",
  "2161": "You screwed Tommy! You'd better run. Fast.",
  "2162": "Get your fat ass back in the truck! Do it right or we screw you instead.",
  "2163": "We need two yellow cabs for a bank job. Bring 'em to the docks in New Guernsey.",
  "2164": "I gotta keep movin', man. Answer the phone in North West New Guernsey.",
  "2165": "My brother knows I'm bangin' his wife. Waste the sonofabitch before he finds me.",
  "2166": "The man's long gone. You got any idea what this is gonna do to my weekend, uh?",
  "2167": "Hey! I owe you one, man. Good job.",
  "2171": "Bubby's wife, Skye, has been visitin' a friend in Central Estoria. Go get her.",
  "2172": "Hey, good lookin'! Take me... to the hotel Mon Signor in Central Kings. You TEASE!",
  "2173": "My - uh - personal trainer is waiting in South East Brocklyn. Can we get him, pretty please?",
  "2174": "Hi, hon'! Miss me? Take us back to the hotel in Central Kings - and take it slow.",
  "2175": "Thanks, hon'! Let's keep this between us. I'm SURE I can make it worth your while.",
  "2176": "Who the hell are you? Get the hell outta here, asshole.",
  "2177": "The taxi's in a hun'red pieces and Skye split with a trucker. You WILL die.",
  "2178": "You put Skye in hospital. Bubby wants to put you in a box. Lie low for a while.",
  "2179": "Skye's in hospital, ya shit. The taxi blew and she almost choked on the guy's dick.",
  "2181": "SHIT! Brad's DEAD! What am I gonna do now, uh? The pool man's off this afternoon...",
  "2182": "Ya left her in the street? Shit, she ain't gonna love ya for that. Blow! Now!",
  "2183": "I'm sorry, sir, but this vehicle hasn't been checked into this hotel. Registered guests and authorized taxi firms only.",
  "2186": "Two guys tore up the Cat House in South Island City. Started on the girls, too. Real messy. Bubby wants them screwed.",
  "2187": "Some mutha's called the cops. Get over to Seymour Reamer's at Brocklyn Docks.",
  "2188": "Another wise guy! Leave the car and split before I call the cops.",
  "2189": "Pablo needs picking up. Fast. We left ya a cop car in South West Park. Go get it.",
  "2191": "Shit! It was a fix! Take me back to my place in South East Tellburg.",
  "2192": "Thanks, man. Keep your ear to the ground. You hear the name Cabot, you call me.",
  "2193": "We can't use this pieceashit, man! Get outta here before I break y' face.",
  "2194": "You wasted the patrol car, man! Now what are we gonna do, uh?",
  "2195": "Pablo and the ride are screwed. So will you be if you ain't careful.",
  "2196": "Look, man, that vehicle ain't on my list. Take a hike!",
  "2197": "Looks like Pablo had a bad accident, you asswipe. Lucky for you he ain't dead.",
  "2198": "The cops got Pablo and the diamonds. Bubby's gonna feed ya y' dick.",
  "2199": "Bubby wants you to know that you screwed months of work and he's gonna hurt ya. Bye.",
  "2211": "It's cool, you can go back. I taught the asshole not to shoot his mouth off.",
  "2212": "Hey! You want a nice gold chain? A ring? This asshole don't need 'em no more...",
  "2213": "Too late, shithead. Dalgetti got nervous. Dump the car somewhere it won't be found.",
  "2214": "I don't know who you are, but you got five seconds to split before I call the cops.",
  "2215": "The mobile's being scanned. I'm callin' North East Kings. Be there.",
  "2216": "Jesus! You ever had a car you DIDN'T blow up, man? YOU are a liability.",
  "2217": "That ain't the car Jimmy said was comin'. You sure you got the right one?",
  "2221": "IT'S A TRAP! Sonetti's rigged this bitch to blow if it drops under 50. Keep goin' until we figure somethin' out.",
  "2222": "The bomb's radio receiver's disabled. You can pull over now. Oh yeah - Bubby needs a couple of Mundanos at Ardler docks.",
  "2223": "Good job, man. Bubby sends his regards. The cash is in your account... now.",
  "2224": "Did that hurt? Ah hope so. You drive like my Gran'ma - and she's been dead f' years.",
  "2226": "That truck belongs to some white trash patriot group - and it's fat with plastique. Go to the pool hall in Central Kings.",
  "2227": "Pull over and count yourself lucky. We jammed the receiver to Head FM.",
  "2228": "Shit, man! You almost blew up a block and walked away. Let's hope they find a donor.",
  "2229": "You picked a fine time to get caught. Now the militia want y' ass. Start runnin'!",
  "2236": "Sonetti's movin' shit through the subway system. Bubby wants it stopped. Take this case to South East Guernsey station.",
  "2237": "Drop the case and move your ass! Fast!",
  "2238": "Too late, man! You missed the damn train!",
  "2239": "The body count's at 127 dead, 220 hurt and it's still risin'! Good job, man!",
  "2241": "Get on the next train. Sonetti's latest shipment's on it.",
  "2246": "There's a bitch in Central Park. The boss had her last night, and this mornin' his wallet's gone. Dispose of her.",
  "2247": "One of Don Sonetti's guys wants to talk to you, kid. Go to the alley behind the Strip Club in North West Park. Now.",
  "2248": "OK, kid, get out of the vehicle. Nice and easy now...",
  "2249": "You killed Sonetti's right hand man! You got some serious explainin' to do.",
  "2311": "My Sasha's been kidnapped! The kidnapper's calling the phone in North West Ardler! Soon! Please! Save her!",
  "2312": "OK, shithead, you do anythin' I don't tell you, the bitch dies. You got 30 seconds to answer the phone in Central Estoria.",
  "2313": "Feeling fit, huh? Bring the money to Law Island Bridge, and don't piss me off!",
  "2314": "Hey! Thanks a lot, buddy. I left the bitch in the trunk of a car in East Eaglewood.",
  "2315": "The cops brought back Sasha. Lucky for you someone heard her barkin' in a trunk.",
  "2316": "Quit screwin' me! Go get the bitch. And if a hair on her head's split, I hurt you.",
  "2317": "You got her! Is she OK? Bring her to the Splendido hotel in North Island City.",
  "2318": "You did REAL good, kid. I won't forget it. Here, go get yourself a pizza.",
  "2319": "You killed Sasha, shithead. We bought the boss a new puppy, but it ain't the same. Now Bubby wants to hurt ya. Bad.",
  "2326": "You want a cut from a bank job, you go get the patrol car in Guernsey City.",
  "2327": "You wanna be careful with this thing, it's got more ooh-la-la than a Brocklyn bitch. Take it to the North West Fort Law bank.",
  "2328": "Hold it! Security! Can I see your pass? No, not your ass... OK, on ya go.",
  "2329": "You do not have the correct authorisation. Stay in your vehicle with your hands on the wheel. The police are on their way.",
  "2331": "Shit, these cops are pussies. Go get m' man from the bank. AND NO MESSIN' AROUND!",
  "2332": "Some advice, kid. You get someone thinkin' he's Chuck Bronson... Don't mess around. Break his face. Now move!",
  "2333": "I don't know who you are, baby, but you ain't comin' in here in that pieceashit.",
  "2334": "Thanks, man. You m' man, yeah? You wanna have my sister, you let me know. She hot.",
  "2335": "You candy-ass sonofabitch. That's no use to us. Get outta here!",
  "2336": "You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off the bank. Beat it!",
  "2337": "You know how much I paid for a cop car? It's comin' outta y' hide, asshole!",
  "2338": "Tommy's almost dead, shithead, and now the cops got him. Get out of my sight.",
  "2339": "You blew up the goddamn car and the cops got Tommy. Get outta my town.",
  "2341": "Split on me and I'm gonna cut out ya heart with a rusty spoon. Get on with the job.",
  "2342": "What the hell ya DOIN'? Tommy's at the bank. You want him to catch a goddamn bus or a cold? Get your ass over there.",
  "2343": "Hey! HEY! Where ya goin'? Get back here!",
  "2346": "Hey, my man! I got some some fun for ya. Go to North Guernsey. I left a van there.",
  "2347": "There's a sporty car movin' through town. Blow it to pieces with these model cars I fixed with bombs.",
  "2348": "You MISSED! Mom's still alive an' I'm gonna have to pay the rent, you shithead.",
  "2349": "Bye, Mom! Teach the bitch to bug ME for the goddamn rent...",
  "2351": "The van's wasted! Now I'm gonna have to pay the rent. You sure make it hard f' me.",
  "2352": "You goddamn pieceashit. Walk out on me again, I'm chokin' ya with ya pop's dick.",
  "2356": "Sonetti's got a shipment of shit in. Word is, it's in a van in West Guernsey City.",
  "2357": "It's a fix! The van's rigged. Take it to Vesuvio in North West Hackenslash.",
  "2358": "You lucky sonofabitch. Another bump and we'd have buried ya in a matchbox.",
  "2359": "Take this thing to Seymour Reamer's place in West Guernsey City.",
  "2361": "That dick Seymour called. Look, go to Crazy Bob's place in East Hackenslash.",
  "2362": "Get rid of that Reamer asshole for me, would ya, kid? Head back to Hackenslash.",
  "2363": "Don't let that asswipe get away!",
  "2364": "Well, that's one less pain in the ass. Thanks, kid. How about dinner sometime?",
  "2365": "Look, asshole, this ain't the van I was waitin' for, so turn around and blow.",
  "2366": "Say, you ain't who I were expectin'! Saddle up and mosey on outta here, cowboy.",
  "2367": "You dick! This ain't the van I'm waitin' for. Turn round and make tracks - fast.",
  "2368": "Thanks, shithead. Now you owe me a truck.",
  "2369": "My man's been wasted. Looks like you's in some real deep shit now.",
  "2371": "Leave the van and the cops are gonna get it with ya prints all over it. Asshole!",
  "2372": "If you ain't takin' a leak, you'd better get back in the van and finish this job!",
  "2373": "Get back in the goddamn van, sonofabitch, or I'm gonna kill ya m'self.",
  "2374": "Hey, Sonetti's got a deal goin' down in South East Estoria. Waste 'em all...",
  "2375": "You sweet, sick sonofabitch. Get yourself back to Vega's pad in South West Brocklyn.",
  "2376": "Bubby's feelin' horny. He's gaggin' for the Mayoress. Go get the bitch. There's a limo in North Island City you can use.",
  "2377": "Her holiness is opening something in North East New Guernsey City. Bring her here before he loses his rag - and his hard-on.",
  "2378": "You work for Bubby! Oh thank God. I gotta get laid soon or I'm gonna go blind! South East Fort Law. And - uh - HURRY!",
  "2379": "Thanks. You might wanna run a rag over the back seat or something.",
  "2381": "That's the wrong rig! How the hell ya gonna finish this game at this rate?",
  "2382": "That limousine used to belong to the Pope. And you blew it. Are you in deep shit!",
  "2383": "Shit, you just damaged the Mayoress! Now Bubby's hot 'n' horny and PISSED!",
  "2384": "The Mayoress is wasted, but Bubby don't wanna a corpse. He wants to hurt you now.",
  "2385": "Don't leave the goddamn limo! The Lady don't like to be left alone for long.",
  "2386": "And where do you think YOU are going? Get back here and take me to Bubby. NOW!",
  "2391": "Shit, someone's kidnapped my wife! I gotta get the bitch back before anyone notices. Go to the phone in North West Hackenslash.",
  "2392": "Hey, shitter! Bring the shitting money to the phone in South East Hackenslash. Now.",
  "2393": "OK, shitty. North East Brix. Quick!",
  "2394": "You made it! Good. Go to the Eaglewood bridge and throw the money to the boat.",
  "2395": "Shit, my wife got away on her own. Now she wants her ass fixed. Where's my money?",
  "2396": "My wife's safe! Now she wants her titties fixed. There goes another ten grand...",
  "2397": "The DA's in West Eaglewood Hospital with an ingrown toenail. Bubby wants to talk to him. Go get an ambulance.",
  "2398": "Bring the asshole to the meat warehouse in Central Brix.",
  "2399": "Hang the shithead from a hook by his ass! Not you, kid. I want you to collect a car in South West Estoria. GO!",
  "2411": "The Angels stole a car and some of the boss' more - ah - private home videos. Get them back. Fast.",
  "2412": "Come to the hotel in North East Tellburg. Hey! Maybe we can look at those tapes before we give 'em back...",
  "2413": "You saved the boss some shit there. Listen, Cabot's coming into town to see Sonetti. Follow him. I want them dead.",
  "2414": "There's a car in Central Hackenslash and it's packed with punch. Go pick it up.",
  "2415": "Head back to Sonetti's place. The bald man's inside with Joe and Eddie.",
  "2416": "You blew it! You freak! I guess it's time Fisty Morgan paid ya mom a visit.",
  "2417": "Yeah! Screw you AND your diamond heist! Messy and malicious, just how we like it.",
  "2418": "Shit! You didn't take out Sonetti? Taught that fat shit and his boy a lesson though!",
  "2419": "That's the wrong car, asshole. Get lost.",
  "2421": "That was the only car we had. Now there's no way you can blow Sonetti now!",
  "2422": "There's a shipment of shit in the trunk of a car in South East Hackenslash. Fetch!",
  "2423": "Bring the car to Coffey's in South West Brix. Leave the shit alone - it's cut.",
  "2424": "The cops picked up Pablo. Last I heard they were in South East Estoria. He'd better get to the office alive...",
  "2425": "At last - it's you. I'm sick of this shit. I'm off to somewhere hot, like Vice City.",
  "2426": "Wake up, shithead! You bring the car with the shit in it back here.",
  "2427": "There was over a million in uncut shit in that car. I'm gonna eat ya face.",
  "2428": "Pablo's dead, ya shit! Stay outta my way or I'm gonna gag ya with my ass.",
  "2429": "Jimmy needs a good driver. There's a car waitin' for ya at South Brocklyn Docks.",
  "2431": "How ya doin', man? Let's get outta here! Bubby's place is in North West Kings.",
  "2432": "Shit. My bitch wife just wasted the maid. Musta caught her with the pool guy again. The body's in a car in Central Kings.",
  "2433": "Now ya got the car, take it to Reeve's in North East Estoria. Mind the cops.",
  "2434": "An overrated hitman called Dumb Kurt just hit town. Hit him with a rigged car.",
  "2435": "Murdered Dumb Kurt? I'm prouda ya. Now, if only we could get rid of The Man...",
  "2436": "You missed! Now there's no stoppin' the rot - and no way to save the situation.",
  "2437": "You want me to take a bus or somethin'? This wreck's no goddamn use, asshole!",
  "2438": "Where's Jimmy? I'm warnin' you, kid - one more mistake and I'm gonna eat ya alive!",
  "2439": "There's nothin' here. Shit! You stole the wrong car, shithead!",
  "2441": "Next time you mess up, I'm gonna make sure y' end up in the morgue not the hospital.",
  "2442": "You think I'm made of money? Quit trashin' my cars or I thrash you.",
  "2443": "How did ya manage to screw the car AND Jimmy, asshole?",
  "2444": "You wasted Jimmy and the car, and the cops got the goddamn money. You! Are! DEAD!",
  "2445": "You trashed the car with the stiff in it? You know what my wife's gonna do to me?",
  "2446": "The cops are on ya tail. There's a car ya can use at the Central Brix hospital.",
  "2447": "Take the car to Mel's Respray Shop in Central Brocklyn.",
  "2448": "Bring the car to the warehouse in Brocklyn docks and BE CAREFUL! I got a job for ya.",
  "2449": "There's a patrol car in South West Hackenslash. It's clean. Go get it.",
  "2451": "I got the files. Shit! Aliens. Kennedys. Gremlin. Everythin'! Let's get outta here!",
  "2452": "So ya got the shit. Great. How d' ya fancy dinner at my house tonight?",
  "2453": "You don't wanna end up like the car, do ya, kid? Don't screw up again!",
  "2454": "That ain't the goddamn car you were meant to get, asshole. Get outta here. NOW!",
  "2455": "You think cop cars grow on trees? Listen, kid, you screwed up once too often...",
  "2456": "You wasted the car AND my guy Mason. I'm gonna nail ya goddamn head to y' ass.",
  "2457": "He's dead, shithead! Now I ain't gonna find out about DMA, the CIA and the NSA.",
  "2458": "That was your last chance, dick. I ain't bailin' you again. Next time you die.",
  "2459": "Book a room, kid. Next time you go in, y' ain't comin' out!",
  "2461": "HEY! Where the hell's Mason? Where's the guy I sent you to pick up, ya dick?",
  "2462": "Mason's dead. You any idea how long it took to set up this deal, shithead?",
  "2463": "That ain't the vehicle I'm lookin' for, asshole.",
  "2466": "You want some easy cash? I got a friend in need of two Pickups at Island View docks.",
  "2467": "There's a guy in North East Guernsey City and he don't wanna pay me. Screw him.",
  "2468": "A good lesson well taught, kid. Say, you are one sick puppy, you know that? Now get your ass back here.",
  "2469": "Sonetti's dealing a truckload of shit to kids outside Guernsey station. We want the car with the shit in it. GET IT!",
  "2471": "Bubby says take the car to Shitter's pad in South New Guernsey. Don't get pulled!",
  "2472": "Great! Leave the car here. Help yourself to some shit if ya want.",
  "2473": "That ain't the car I'm lookin' for. I don't know you, man. Split!",
  "2474": "You were meant to bring the car with the shit in it. Asshole.",
  "2475": "Shit! The car's up in smoke and the shit's gone with it. Breathe in then beat it.",
  "2481": "It is time! We will show the world that I am the one true God! Take the next train from the Island Heights subway station.",
  "2482": "The train is packed with explosives. I bid you farewell...",
  "2483": "The day of judgement is at hand! Streets will run red with the blood of the saved! Stay on the train! Die well!",
  "2484": "Sorry about that, kid. I was kinda screwed on shit. Impressed you made it, man.",
  "2485": "Only the righteous shall be saved! You! You are a shithead and bound for Hell!",
  "2486": "Cowardice is a mortal SIN! I shall strip thy flesh and cast you down!",

  "3234": "I said to take the jeep, mister. Game over!",
  "3235": "Very good. I've disabled the bomb. Now, some of my clients are coming looking for you. Last man standing keeps the money.",

  "3255": "You have done well. Uncle Fu asks me to convey his gratitude for your service.",
  "3256": "I should have entrusted this task to someone reliable. The D.A. will not be that vulnerable again!",
  "3257": "Uncle Fu needs you. Go to the phone in the Market, I will explain what is required.",
  "3258": "The mayor has foolishly refused to pay for our protection of civic properties. He must learn to value our services.",

  "3284": "The case is hidden just over there. It was all a mistake. I never intended to sell it. Honestly! Just let me go huh? Please?",
  "3285": "A job well done! We may name a restaurant after you some day.",
  "3286": "Idiot! I told you to make sure that you had the documents before you killed him! Now we can never be sure they are safe!",
  "3287": "Very good. Now retrieve the documents and return them to us at once.",
  "3288": "Your tactics leave much to be desired! Be more careful from now on!",
  "3289": "One of our leaders, Keith Ham Yel Tun, has failed us. Honor demands that he kill himself, but he must be questioned first!",

  "3297": "Wasteful cretin! Get another taxi at once!",
  "3298": "Very good. Kindly detonate the truck here.",

  "3374": "Ok, homeboy, we get even with Senor Tallon when he goes off duty. Get to the station before him, then wait for my signal.",
  "3375": "Now then, pretty boy, when I tell you, turn that stinkin' joto into salsa! Make sure he don' reach his house alive!",
  "3376": "Vaya el diablo Tallon! You done good, amigo. Come an' spend the night at my hacienda so I can thank you properly.",
  "3377": "What's your problem, cabron? You got to learn to control yourself! In future, you do what I say, you got that quebracho?",
  "3378": "You miss your chance, cabron. Now I have to do it the messy way. I will send Jefe, I can count on him!",
  "3381": "That was beautiful! If I was not on the other end of a phone, I would kiss you!",
  "3382": "Eh, stupido! What were you doing? If the federales find anything on that car, I send YOU to swim with the fishes!",
  "3383": "'Ey, amigo, I got a job for you, but I wan' to make sure you are no' being watched. Go to Richman, I call you there.",
  "3384": "I have a pretty friend in Woodside who's expecting me. I don' like to keep him waiting. Go collect him for me.",
  "3388": "Bad news, amigo. Jefe heard on the radio that a TV crew film' your latest escapade. I call you when I find out where they are.",
  "3389": "Caray! FOUR TV vans are cruisin' the city. We don' know which has the film, so get rid of them all! Richman is the nearest!",
  "3391": "Jefe tells me there is one in Sunview. Don' hang aroun', go an' take it out!",
  "3392": "The last one should be nearby. After this we can relax a little, no?",
  "3393": "You are a tough hombre, eh? I am glad to have a strong young man like you on my side. I like you ver' much.",
  "3411": "The Yakuza have crossed the line! They have taken a shipment on it's way to one of my factories.",
  "3412": "Ver' good, muchacho, but I am no' satisfied yet. Destroy another!",

  "3415": "You havin' trouble with this, maricon? Try it again, and don' screw it up!",

  "3417": "You no' doin' too good here, cabron. Go back an' try again!",
  "3418": "You careless gringo! Be more careful with the things I entrust to you, or you will be in serious trouble, comprende?",
  "3419": "You try my patience! If you keep messin' up, I have to hurt you. Hear me, cabron?",
  "3421": "Well, at least you got somethin' right! I forgive you for your earlier mistake, but be warned, I am no' always so lenient!",
  "3422": "Take out those cars, an' get a move on, I don' got all day you know!",
  "3423": "What a lovely car... I like the leather against my skin. We take a trip soon, no?",
  "3424": "Ey, amigo. You know that I like you, but Jefe, he is jealous. He say you no' up to the job. So I make a little bet with him.",
  "3425": "I bet him you can kill eight federales in less than eight minutes. He say no way! You show him, pretty-boy!",
  "3426": "Hahaha! Tha's the way, homeboy! The nex' one is in Chinatown.",
  "3427": "Ey ey ey! We're smokin' now, amigo! There's one in Glenwood go get him!",

  "3431": "Heh! The federales will be after your blood for this! Get over to Sunview and kill yourself another pig!",
  "3432": "Ay caramba! Jefe was right about you! This will cost me a lot of Tequila! You let me down cabron!",
  "3433": "You are too slow for this! Jefe was right, you are jus' a typical Yankee maricon!",
  "3434": "Yeah! Pay up Jefe, the pretty-boy has done the business! Well done, amigo, we share the Tequila Jefe is about to buy me, no?",
  "3435": "The cops have realized what is goin' on! They are after you, amigo! Careful now!",
  "3436": "I guess Jefe was right. You can no' handle yourself as well as I thought. Too bad, there would have been a bonus for you.",
  "3437": "A friend of mine is makin' a movie. He promised me a part if I supply some of the 'props' he needs. Get me an ambulance!",
  "3438": "You crazy? Get another ambulance... an' hurry, I don' got all day!",
  "3439": "Don' jus' leave it lying there, cabron! Bring it to the garage!",
  "3441": "You crazy gringo! Go an' get another fire truck an' bring it in.",
  "3442": "Go back an' get that fire truck! My career in the movies depends on it!",
  "3443": "Ver' good, amigo. Now then, next on his list is... a Juggernaut? I don' know what he needs it for, but get one anyway!",
  "3444": "Caray, you sure go through cars at some rate cabron! Get a replacement, an' quick!",
  "3445": "Get that truck to the garage double-quick, cabron! I am no' happy to wait ver' long!",
  "3446": "Tha's perfect, pretty-boy. Now, the last thing we need is a police car. I'm sure you can find one lyin' aroun' someplace.",
  "3447": "Well that was no' too clever now, huh? Go an' get another one, idiot!",
  "3448": "Get back to the police car an' bring it to the garage. My friend is ver' impatient!",
  "3449": "Well done. I remember you when I am rich an' famous. Maybe I find a part for you too, no? There must be a love scene, eh?",
  "3451": "We have been discovered! Kill the gringo!",
  "3452": "Make sure he does no' escape!",
  "3453": "Good work, amigo. Keep the money in the case as a bonus. Buy yourself a nice sweater or somethin'.",
  "3454": "I despair of you, cabron! You can no' do even the simplest job. Typical Yankee!",
  "3455": "Another gang has set up a laboratory in an old underground warehouse. Jefe has left the equipment you need. Take it out!",
  "3456": "You goddamn Yankee maricon! How am I supposed to make any money if you wreck all my property! Get out of here, idiot!",
  "3457": "The base is heavily guarded, but you should be able to get one of these babies in, no? Only five to play with though!",
  "3459": "I can no' believe you used them all an' could no' get one in there! Ay caramba! I should have let Jefe do it instead of you!",
  "3461": "I have a little job for you, my friend. I will call you in Eagleside shortly.",
  "3462": "I have a ver' important job for you. Go to the phone at Richman, I will explain.",
  "3463": "I wan' to talk to you about somethin' real important. I will call you in Excalibur.",
  "3464": "I have an urgent job for you. Ver' hush hush. I will call you in Sunview.",
  "3465": "You are too soft, gringo! Nex' time be more careful. You are no use to me dead... well, no' much anyway.",
  "3466": "You idiot! How dare you kill anyone before I tell you is ok! You wait until I tell you before you move, maricon!",
  "3467": "Goddamn gringo traitor! Kill him, muchachos!",
  "3468": "Now I let you into a secret. Paco is the one who is workin' behind my back. When I tell you, kill him in the confusion.",
  "3469": "You try my patience, cabron! Don' think you can do your own thing! If I wanted you to kill them, I would have asked you to.",
  "3471": "Ok, amigo. Kill Paco NOW! It will look like he caught a stray bullet!",
  "3472": "Hey! If I wan' you to kill my own men, I will ask you. Be careful, I am no' one to be messin' aroun' with!",
  "3473": "Die, maggot!",
  "3474": "Too late, cabron! The tapes are bein' broadcast right now! I would lay low for a while if I were you!",
  "3475": "'Ey, gringo! You are no' finished yet! Go back and get those plates changed before I lose my patience!",
  "3476": "Get back to that truck and take it to the warehouse! Move it, cabron!",
  "3477": "Get away from my truck you goddamn little ratbastard!",
  "3478": "Oh, jus' wonderful! Now I never know what was in there. I send Jefe nex' time. You don' got what it takes, cabron.",
  "3479": "Caramba! Why do I keep you aroun'? I could stick your head in a burrito an' have it for lunch!",
  "3481": "While you were lying down on the job, Jefe had to finish things up. He is getting tired of cleaning up after you, amigo!",
  "3482": "No, no, leave me alone!",
  "3483": "Go away! Can't you see the gerbils are coming? We all have to flee...FLEE!",
  "3484": "No! Pleesh! Tha'sh no' fair! Hic!",
  "3485": "You will no' take me back alive, maricon!",
  "3486": "Get away from me, or I will kill you, gringo!",
  "3487": "You won' get me you murderin' gringo!",
  "3488": "Try your luck, cabron, I kill you first!",
  "3489": "You are incompetent, cabron! If the federales find any evidence against me, I will turn your intestines into taco meat!",
  "3491": "Ok, amigo! Do it NOW! NOW!",
  "3492": "You're gonna get it now ya little weasel!",
  "3494": "Cavay, maricon! What is it with you and cars? You can no' keep them intact! Now I never know who was responsible!",
  "3495": "Madre Dios! They have killed my pretty friend! I will have blood for this!",
  "3496": "Someone saw a car hangin' aroun' jus' before the blast. Find it an' get the driver. Don' kill him, make him talk!",
  "3497": "Ok, muchacho, go get a car wired an' park it outside the hideout. We teach these gringos to mess with El Burro!",
  "3498": "Park it right at the front door an' set it off. Let them taste their own medicine!",
  "3499": "Good, amigo! My enemies will think twice about pulling another stunt like that, no?",
  "3511": "Ok, pretty-boy, come to Sailor's Wharf an' I will see what I have for you to do.",
  "3512": "There's a little job that needs taken care of. Come to the phone in Sailor's Wharf an' I will explain everything.",
  "3513": "Looking for somethin' to do, amigo? Go to Sunview an' I will be happy to oblige.",
  "3514": "I give you a little somethin' to do if you go to the Marina. Don' be long though!",
  "3515": "You screwed up, gringo! Lost the money, an' kept the boys waiting! Jefe had to go in your place an' he is no' happy!",
  "3516": "Ok, muchacho, you got one more to go! Now get across to Woodside and finish the job!",
  "3517": "Amigo, I don' know what was in that truck, but my boys who unloaded it got some kind of weird disease or somethin'.",
  "3518": "Jefe managed to steal one of those trucks, but my boys who unloaded it got some kind of weird disease or somethin'.",
  "3519": "He has arranged to meet at his mansion in Sunview. Take my car an' find out what he wants. Careful, I don' trust that gringo!",
  "3521": "I wan' you to wander aroun' their turf an' take out a few of their fancy cars! They must pay for what they stole from me!",
  "3522": "Ver' good, amigo, now take it to our garage in Glenwood.",
  "3561": "'Ey, Amigo, how you doin'? They call me El Burro. Maybe one day you find out why, no? Anyway, meantimes I have work for you. I will call you at Telephone Hill.",
  "3562": "Ok, hombre, if you need a job, jus' come to the phones in Sailors Wharf an' I put you to good use, no?",
  "3563": "Ok, pretty-boy, you have proved yourself loyal to me. Now it is time for us to get to know each other better. Come aroun' to the Red Clam bar. I will meet you there.",
  "3564": "Amigo, you know that I like you, but if you don' bring me that car right now I'll cut your heart out and eat it! Understand?",
  "3565": "My clients are hot on your tail. I've left another car there for you. I advise you to take it.",
  "3566": "I'm impressed. Get in that car and I'll make you a proposition. Otherwise... you may soon be involuntarily ventilated!",
  "3567": "My clients are closing in. I'd advise you to take the car I've left for you.",
  "3568": "I will no' run no more! Come an' get me, maricon!",
  "3569": "That's one of El Burro's men... WASTE HIM!",
  "3571": "Ok, amigo, jus' wait there for Tallon. He will be along shortly.",
  "3572": "No no no! You are too slow for this work! Jefe was right, you are jus' a typical Yankee maricon!",
  "3573": "You killed him you crazy gringo! Dead men don' tell no tales, maricon! Now we never know who was behind this.",
  "3574": "Get after him an' put the frighteners on him! Don' hurt him though, we need him alive!",
  "3575": "Don't hurt me! Jimmy the Shovel sent us. The others are holed up at a safehouse in the Marina! Now lemme go, huh?",
  "3576": "He got away from you? Madre dios! Now we must be on our guard all the time! Idiot!",
  "3577": "He is mad! Run for your lives!",
  "3578": "Is that the best you can do? You should work out!",
  "3579": "Did your grandmother teach you to fight?",
  "3581": "Ouch! That hurt! No, really it did! Hahahahaha!",
  "3582": "Stop wasting time! No Chin is still on the loose! Now get on with your job at once!",
  "3583": "You have lost them? Then we have lost No Chin! This is a disgraceful failure!",
  "3584": "El Burro, we've been expecting you, do come in.",
  "3585": "May the gods take pity on my wretched soul!",
  "3586": "Uncle Fu has no more work for you. If you wish to earn his respect you must bring chaos and destruction to the streets!",
  "3587": "I got no more work for you. You wan' to prove yourself to me, make the streets run red. Let's see what you are made of!",
  "3588": "Uncle Fu wishes to test your skills against one of his other men. Go to Woodside and await instruction.",
  "3589": "You need not have come. I will beat you easily, American dog!",
  "3591": "You prove yourself worthy. I will contact you with details of your next assignment.",
  "3592": "You have proved unworthy. I will keep a close eye on your work from now on.",
  "3593": "By the seven horned devil spawn, what treachery is this? You dishonorable servant! Get out of my sight at once!",
  "3594": "Careless oaf! Our work is too important to be left in your clumsy hands! Go and find something else to do.",
  "3595": "Dishonorable peasant! If you cannot win without cheating, I have no use for you!",
  "3596": "I can see you are both incompetent. What a sorry pair you are!",
  "3597": "Get away from me!",
  "3598": "Keep your stinkin' hands off my truck, punk!",
  "3599": "Hurry it up, pretty boy! If you don' move quick my friend will go elsewhere, and that would end my movie career!",
